# Mentorship in the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program

## Overview

Mentorship plays a crucial role in the **AsyncAPI Maintainership Program** by fostering collaboration between experienced maintainers and aspiring contributors. This structured mentorship initiative helps mentees gain real-world experience while contributing to open-source projects within the AsyncAPI ecosystem.

The goal of the mentorship program is to **pair promising open-source contributors with experienced mentors**, ensuring knowledge transfer, skill development, and long-term sustainability of AsyncAPI projects.

## Objectives of the Mentorship Program

- To create a structured learning environment for contributors aspiring to become maintainers.
- To transfer **technical and project management skills** from mentors to mentees.
- To encourage long-term engagement within the AsyncAPI community.
- To build a **diverse and skilled** group of future maintainers.

## How to Participate

Participants in the AsyncAPI Maintainership Program can take on different roles:

- Overseeing the mentee selection process.
- Ensuring adherence to program guidelines.

### **2. Mentor**

A **Mentor** is an experienced contributor who provides guidance, feedback, and technical support to mentees. Mentors help mentees understand project requirements, coding standards, and best practices in open-source development. Responsibilities include:

- Conducting regular check-ins with mentees.
- Helping mentees navigate challenges and improve their problem-solving skills.

### **3. Mentee**
